Why? 
I noticed that during coding interview, it is super challenging for me to write code in a limited time frame. 
It seems obvious that I need to up-level my python coding skills. It is boring to code each day in leetcode. 
So I found this 100 day of Code challenge which is a sweet spot for me. 
I can find coding practices and review python basics and build profolio projects in python along the way.
The plan is to spend 1 hour each day working on python coding for 100 days.  

Here are my learning notes:
Day 1: Basics: print, variables, string manipulations, data types, numbers, type conversion, operations, f-string
Day 2: Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks and Scope
Day 3: Randomisation, python list
	Programming is like going to the Gym. Need to commit the hour and practice to get the coding muscle built.
	Fun project: Rock, Paper, Scissor Game.
Day 4: Dictionaries and nesting
	To Loop through a dictionary:
	for key in dic_example:
		print(key) # print each key in dictionary
		print(dic_example[key]) # print each value in dictionary
	Nesting:
		1. Nest Dictionaries in List
		2. Nest Dictionaries in Dictionary
		3. Nest List in Dictionary
		4. Nest List in List
Day 5: Functions with Outputs; Docstring (first line after declaraion) 
Day 6: Blackjack game:
	https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack
	Rule:
	## The deck is unlimited in size. 
	## There are no jokers. 
	## The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
	## The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.
	## Use the following list as the deck of cards:
	## cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
	## The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
	## Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
	## The computer is the dealer.
	Logic(need to draw a flow chart)
		Define a function to calculate score to consider how many As player or dealer have
			in the function, put As in a list, the final score is the largest score <= 21 or if over, the min score
		if both have 2 cards, judge if anyone wins at first run 
		ask if player take another card
			if n: 
				compare cards
					???if dealer < 17, dealer add another card
			if y:
				compare cards
					if dealer < 17, dealer add another card 
Day 7: Debugging: How to find and fix errors
	print variables
	Use a debugger
Day 8: IDE, Pycharm, 
	break down the problem by adding TODO
	Project:Coffee Machine
