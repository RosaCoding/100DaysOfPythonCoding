Why? 
I noticed that during coding interview, it is super challenging for me to write code in a limited time frame. 
It seems obvious that I need to up-level my python coding skills. It is boring to code each day in leetcode. 
So I found this 100 day of Code challenge which is a sweet spot for me. 
I can find coding practices and review python basics and build profolio projects in python along the way.
The plan is to spend 1 hour each day working on python coding for 100 days.  

Here are my learning notes:
Day 1: Basics: print, variables, string manipulations, data types, numbers, type conversion, operations, f-string
Day 2: Conditional Statements, Logical Operators, Code Blocks and Scope
Day 3: Randomisation, python list
	Programming is like going to the Gym. Need to commit the hour and practice to get the coding muscle built.
	Fun project: Rock, Paper, Scissor Game.
Day 4: Dictionaries and nesting
	To Loop through a dictionary:
	for key in dic_example:
		print(key) # print each key in dictionary
		print(dic_example[key]) # print each value in dictionary
	Nesting:
		1. Nest Dictionaries in List
		2. Nest Dictionaries in Dictionary
		3. Nest List in Dictionary
		4. Nest List in List
